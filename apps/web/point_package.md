## 3. Point Deduction Logic

When a business awards points to a participant, the system follows this hierarchy for deduction:

1.  **Monthly Allowance:** Points are first deducted from the business's monthly allowance provided by their subscription tier.
2.  **Legacy Extra Points:** If the monthly allowance is exhausted, points are deducted from any legacy "Extra Points" balance the business may have.
3.  **Point Packages:** If both the monthly allowance and legacy points are insufficient, points are deducted from active `BusinessPointPackage`s, prioritizing the oldest active packages first.
